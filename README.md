# Triangle Paths

This project aims to find the minimal path of a given triangle of numbers. For example, consider:
<p align="center"> <img width="auto" height="200" alt="Triangle of Numbers" src="../master/GitHubResources/TriangleOfNumbers.JPG"> </p>

An example of a valid path using the above diagram would be 7 → 6 → 3 → 11. Using this path as an example the minimal path of this would be 7+6+3+11 = 18. The tree that is going to be computed must be inputted into a text file and loaded by the terminal to compute the minimal path length.

The program boots in a terminal like program as illustrated below:

A number of validations in the terminal program are being made for example it checks if the file path is given with the command or not and also goes through the given text file and makes sure that the text file does not consist of any letters.

The commands available in the terminal program are:

| Command                 | Description                                   |
| -------------           | -------------                                 |
| #find <source program>  | To calculate the minimal path of a given file |
| #help                   | To display all the help commands              |
| #quit                   | To Exit the Terminal Program                  |
